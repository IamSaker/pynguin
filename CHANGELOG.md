# Pynguin Changelog

for the source-code artifacts of each version.

## Pynguin 0.6.2

## Pynguin 0.6.1

## Pynguin 0.6.0

- Add support for simple assertion generation (thanks to [@Wooza](https://github.com/Wooza)).
  For now, assertions can only be generated for simple types (`int`, `float`, `str`,
  `bool`).  All other assertions can only check whether or not a result of a method
  call is `None`.
  The generated assertions are regression assertions, i.e., they record the return
  values of methods during execution and assume them to be correct.
