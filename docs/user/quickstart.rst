Quickstart
==========

Eager to start?  Make sure that Pynguin is :ref:`installed <install>` properly.

Attention!
----------

**Warning:** Pynguin actually executes the code of the subject under test.  That
means, if the code you want to generate tests for does something bad, for example
wipes your disk, there is nothing that prevents it from doing so!
To mitigate this issue, we recommend running Pynguin in a Docker container with
appropriate mounts from the host system's file system.
See the ``pynguin-docker.sh`` script in Pynguin's source repository for documentation
on the necessary mounts.
We do not provide any support and are not reliable if you break your computer by
executing Pynguin on some random code from the internet!
Be careful and check the code before actually executing it—which is good advice anyway.

*Developers:* If you know of a similar technique to Java's security manager mechanism
in Python, which we can use to mitigate this issue, please let us know.

Use the Bundled Example
-----------------------

For a first impression, we use the bundled example file and generate tests for it.
Note that this assumes that you have the source code checked out, installed Pynguin
properly—as mentioned before, we recommend a virtual environment, which needs to be
sourced manually—and that your shell is pointing to the root directory of Pynguin's
source repository.
We run all commands on a command-line shell.

First, let's look at the code of the example file (which is located in
``docs/source/_static/example.py``):

.. literalinclude:: ../source/_static/example.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python
    :lines: 9-

The example is the classical ``triangle`` example from courses on Software Testing,
which yields for three given integers—assumed to be the lengths of the triangle's
edges—what type of triangle it is.
Note that we have annotated all parameter and return types, according to
:pep:`484`.

Before we can start, we create a directory for the output (this assumes you are on a
Linux or macOS machine, but similar can be done on Windows) using the command line::

   $ mkdir -p /tmp/pynguin-results

We will now invoke Pynguin (using its random test-generation algorithm) to let
it generate test cases (we use ``\`` and the line breaks for better readability here,
you can just omit them and type everything in one line)::

   $ pynguin \
       --algorithm RANDOOPY \
       --project_path ./docs/source/_static \
       --output_path /tmp/pynguin-results \
       --module_name example

This runs for quite a while without showing any output.  Thus, to have some output as
well as a more limited time (10 seconds here), we add some more parameters::

   $ pynguin \
       --algorithm RANDOOPY \
       --project_path ./docs/source/_static \
       --output_path /tmp/pynguin-results \
       --module_name example \
       -v
       --budget 10

The output on the command line might be something like the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../source/_static/example-stdout.txt
    :emphasize-lines: 1-3,16-20

The first three line show that Pynguin starts, that it has not gotten any seed—that
is a fixed start number of its (pseudo) random-number generator, and that it starts
sequence generation using the *RANDOOPY* algorithm.
It then yields that it took six algorithm iterations, and concludes with its results:
ten test cases were written to ``/tmp/pynguin/results/test_example.py``, which look
like the following (the result can differ on your machine):

.. literalinclude:: ../source/_static/test_example.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python
    :lines: 8-

As of version 0.6.0, Pynguin is now also able to generate assertions for simple data
types (``int``, ``float``, ``str``, and ``bool``), as well as checks for ``None``
return values.

A Note on Reproducible Runs
---------------------------

According to the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED>`_
it is necessary to set the environment variable ``PYTHONHASHSEED=0`` in order to
achieve a truly deterministic behaviour and computation.
Furthermore, it is necessary to set the ``--seed`` command-line option to a fixed value.
